# Vide-Game-Sales

This dataset portrays the sales figures of diverse video games across North America, Europe, other regions, and globally. It encompasses data associated with game publishers and genres.

Throughout this project, I undertook data cleansing and conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Subsequently, I ventured into implementing various machine learning models, spanning Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KMeans Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. Additionally, I employed techniques like K Nearest Neighbors and the Elbow method for optimal neighbor selection, along with Principal Component Analysis.
